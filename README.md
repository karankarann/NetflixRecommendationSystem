Online streaming platforms like **Netflix** have plenty of movies in their repository and if we can build a **Recommendation System** to recommend **relevant movies** to users, based on their **historical interactions**, this would **improve customer satisfaction** and hence, it will also improve the revenue of the platform. The techniques that we will learn here will not only be limited to movies, it can be any item for which you want to build a recommendation system.
